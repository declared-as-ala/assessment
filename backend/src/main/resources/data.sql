-- Seed test users (passwords are bcrypt hashed "Password1!")
-- Note: Spring Security will hash passwords in the service, so this is commented out
-- We'll create users via registration endpoint or programmatically in DataInitializer

-- User credentials for testing:
-- alice@example.com / Password1!
-- bob@example.com / Password1!
